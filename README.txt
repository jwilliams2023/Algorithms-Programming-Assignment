Final Assignment
Author: Joseph Williams

Summary:
This assignment involved implementing and analyzing algorithms for matrix manipulation and multiplication using Python. The task was completed in a Jupyter Notebook environment, leveraging NumPy for matrix operations and Pandas for data visualization. A PDF document was also created, explaining the time complexities of each algorithm in detail.

Files Included:
main_notebook.ipynb: The Jupyter Notebook containing all the code, data visualization, and markdown explanations.
complexity_analysis.pdf: A document detailing the time complexity analysis for each algorithm.
README.txt: This file.

Environment:
Jupyter Notebook:  Jupyter Labs 4.0.11 - Used for coding and documenting the project.
Python Kernel: Python 3.12.4 (ipykernel)
Libraries Used: NumPy, Pandas.
