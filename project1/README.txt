The author would like to acknowledge the use of ChatGPT, a lan-
guage model developed by OpenAI, in the preparation of this as-
signment. The ChatGPT was used in the following way(s) in this as-
signment:

The base case threshold in the given implementation of algorithm 3:

    if max(p,q,r) < 8:

was resulting in infinite recursion (even for smaller values).

We consulted ChatGPT and noticed that it gave a different base case  

    if p == 1 or q == 1 or r == 1: 

that corrected the recursion error.
