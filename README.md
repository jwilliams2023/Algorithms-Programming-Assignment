# Algorithims Final Assignment

**Author:** Joseph Williams

## Summary
This assignment involved implementing and analyzing algorithms for matrix manipulation and multiplication using Python. The task was completed in a Jupyter Notebook environment, leveraging **NumPy** for matrix operations and **Pandas** for data visualization. A PDF document was also created, explaining the time complexities of each algorithm in detail.

## Files Included:
- **main_notebook.ipynb**: The Jupyter Notebook containing all the code, data visualizations, and markdown explanations.
- **complexity_analysis.pdf**: A document detailing the time complexity analysis for each algorithm.
- **README.md**: This file.

## Environment:
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Version 4.0.11, used for coding and documenting the project.
- **Python Kernel**: Python 3.12.4 (ipykernel)
- **Libraries Used**:
  - **NumPy**: For matrix operations and calculations.
  - **Pandas**: For data manipulation and visualization.

## Instructions:
1. Open the **main_notebook.ipynb** in Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab.
2. Follow along with the code, visualizations, and markdown for explanations of each step.
3. Review the **complexity_analysis.pdf** for detailed time complexity breakdowns of the algorithms implemented.
